<h1>BUDGERIGAR</h1>
<div id="main">
<img class="imagec" src="bird.jpg">
<p>The budgerigar is a long-tailed, seed-eating parrot usually nicknamed the budgie, or in American English, the parakeet. Budgies are the only species in the genus Melopsittacus.
 Naturally, the species is green and yellow with black, scalloped markings on the nape, back, and wings.Budgies are bred in captivity with colouring of blues, whites, yellows, greys, 
and even with small crests. Juveniles and chicks are monomorphic, while adults are told apart by their cere colouring, and their behaviour. First recorded in 1805, budgerigars are
 popular pets around the world due to their small size, low cost, and ability to mimic human speech. They are the <span class="highlight">third most popular pet in the world</span>, 
after the domesticated dog and cat.Budgies are nomadic flock parakeets that have been bred in captivity since the 19th century. In both captivity and the wild, budgerigars breed 
opportunistically and in pairs.</p>

<h2>BEHAVIOUR</h2>
<p class="para1"><br><B>BREEDING</B></br><br>Breeding in the wild generally takes place between June and September in northern Australia and between August and January in the south, although budgerigars 
are opportunistic breeders and respond to rains when grass seeds become most abundant.They show signs of affection to their flockmates by preening or feeding one another. Budgerigars
 feed one another by eating the seeds themselves, and then regurgitating it into their flockmate's mouth.Females only leave their nests for very quick defecations, stretches and 
quick meals once they have begun incubating and are by then almost exclusively fed by their mate (usually at the nest's entrance). Females will not allow a male to enter the nest, unless he forces his way inside.
Depending on the clutch size and the beginning of incubation, the age difference between the first and last hatchling can be anywhere from 9 to 16 days. At times, the parents may begin
 eating their own eggs due to feeling insecure in the nest box.</br></p>
<img class="imagec" src="bird2.jpg">
<p class="para2"><br><b>DEVELOPMENT</b></br><br>Eggs take about 18–20 days before they start hatching. The hatchlings are altricial – blind, naked, unable to lift their head and totally helpless,
 and their mother feeds them and keeps them warm constantly. Around 10 days of age, the chicks' eyes will open, and they will start to develop feather down. The appearance of down occurs
 at the age for closed banding of the chicks. Budgerigars' closed band rings must be neither larger nor smaller than 4.0 to 4.2 mm.They develop feathers around three weeks of age.
 (One can often easily note the colour mutation of the individual birds at this point.) At this stage of the chicks' development, the male usually has begun to enter the nest to help 
his female in caring and feeding the chicks. Some budgerigar females, however,totally forbid the male from entering the nest and thus take the full responsibility of rearing the chicks 
until they fledge.</br></p>
<h2>Budgies Can Learn to Talk Better Than Some Larger Parrots</h2>
<p class="para3"> Budgies certainly have a knack for <span class="highlight">learning to "speak"</span>, and many times they speak with greater clarity and broader vocabularies than larger parrot species such as macaws and cockatoos.
While their voices are small and gravelly-sounding, budgies have an impressive ability to pick up on human words and phrases, and even using them in proper context sometimes. 
They are a great choice for those new to bird ownership who want to own a talking parrot.</p>
